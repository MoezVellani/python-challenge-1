# python-challenge-1

This is a challenege where I was tasked with designing an interactive ordering sytem from a food truck menu using my current skills of python. The ordering system should allow 
customers to place orders, store them, and then print a receipt with the total price of all the items ordered. 

I used the assistance of our Xpert Learning Assistant for this assignment where I asked for examples and to help define various problems for steps #4 - #11.
